# College Major Backgrounds and Effects

This repo is for Dylan Holliday's and Max Collins' final project for Stat 184. Our project goes over the trends and insights from post-secondary majors: how one’s socioeconomic status plays a role in their major, as well as their major’s effect on their income after graduation.

## Overview

We want to explore these relationships through a series of research questions. These questions include, "What is the highest earning major?", "Are proportions of the race of college graduates different than overall racial proportions throughout the country?", and, "How does the average median salary affect graduation from certain major categories amongst racial groups?"

## Repo Structure

All .csv from this repo are the files that we obtained from FiveThirtyEight's free online repo about college major statistics, and the .xlsx is from the US Census webiste and is ebing used as our secondary data source. Some of files in this repo, such as he project guidelines file, came from the original repo we copied for this project. Finally, the most important files are our .qmd file that eventually became our .pdf final file that we submitted for our final project. That .qmd file had by far the most commits on it of any of our files as it contained the whole sum of work we did on our final project.
